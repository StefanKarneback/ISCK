	<h3>Can I afford a cooker?</h3>
	
 	<h3>The question is rather if you can afford not to use a solar cooker.
	 </h3>
	<br/>
	Is the cooker expensive?
	<br/ >
	Make an estimation - how much do you pay for fuel today?
	<br/>
	<br/>
	The vendor will give you the exact price for your cooker. Panel ovens and conical cookers are usually the less expensive ones. A panel oven or a conical cooker pay for itself by using it for around 18 meals instead of 2kg (wood fuel) per meal.
<br />
<br/>
	You can often buy the cooker on instalment, but you need to pay a certain amount in cash. 
<br/>
<br/>
After paying for your solar cooker the sun will provide you with free fuel. Take good care of your cooker and it will last for many years.
<br/>
<br/>
Combine with a fireless cooker to keep your meal hot until you want to eat. 
<br/>
<br/>

An estimation of how much you can save by using solar cookers is presented in the table below.  <b>
          (We are waiting for a report with numbers for the table)

<br/>
If you save 2000 Ksh per month, after 8 months, you have saved 16000 Ksh. â€¨
